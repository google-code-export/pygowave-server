# PyGoWave Server - The Headstart #

I couldn't wait until the guys at Google released their reference server implementation, so I decided to build my own in the meantime.

This implementation uses Django - a well-known python web framework - as its backend and is in a very early stage. Just as Google, I want to release it to the public as fast as possible.

In the end, this will eventually be a full-featured server implementation for easy use, extention and integration with your web servers and applications.

Note: All of the code is directly derived from Google's published Wave API and protocol specification and, well, my imagination.

# Attention! PyGoWave source code is now at [GitHub](http://github.com/p2k/pygowave)! #

The source code of PyGoWave has just been migrated to [GitHub](http://github.com/p2k/pygowave). Now anyone is invited to collaborate to PyGoWave. Simply create a fork with your GitHub account and start hacking. If you fixed a bug or added a feature you can issue a pull request and I will review your changes and merge them into our repository.

This project page will still be accessible but no changes will be committed from now on.
