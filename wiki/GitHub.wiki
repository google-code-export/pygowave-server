The source code of !PyGoWave has been moved to [http://github.com/p2k/pygowave GitHub].

!GitHub allows a more open way of collaborative coding. Before this step, !PyGoWave only had one (though pretty active) developer. Now everyone is invited to help developing !PyGoWave.

=== Is the SVN repository gone? ===

Well, you can still check out the alpha 0.3 release here, but no further changes will be added to it from now on.
