= !PyGoWave Server Roadmap =

This is my mini todo list for now.

 * Create data models for basic server operation
 * Think of an event sending/dispatching engine
 * Experiment with robot client libraries
 * Build a small Wave Gadget environment emulator (Javascript) to test some gadgets
 * Try to run an example robot with the server; the Wave API needs some patches to decouple it from the Google App Engine
 * ...
 * Implement playback feature
 * Use distutils to create an installable version
 * Implement Google Wave Federation Protocol
 * Graduate from university and get employed by Google :D
