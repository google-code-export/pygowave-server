# Want the source? Head over to [GitHub](http://github.com/p2k/pygowave)! #

The source code of PyGoWave has been moved to [GitHub](http://github.com/p2k/pygowave).

GitHub allows a more open way of collaborative coding. Before this step, PyGoWave only had one (though pretty active) developer. Now everyone is invited to help developing PyGoWave.

### Is the SVN repository gone? ###

Well, you can still check out the alpha 0.3 release here, but no further changes will be added to it from now on.
```
svn checkout http://pygowave-server.googlecode.com/svn/tags/alpha_0.3 pygowave_project
```
