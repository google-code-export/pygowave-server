# It infected me from the start - I couldn't wait - I realized that someone
# had to do this - and I realized that this someone had to be me
#
# So this is it: My Python/Django server implementation of Google Wave based on
# the open source API and the documentation provided by Google - it's not
# complete but it's enough to get started with gadgets and robots.
#
# Eventually this will become a full-featured Wave Server as Google's reference
# implementation gets public.
